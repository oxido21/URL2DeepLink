# URL2DeepLink
A simple solution to redirect website URL to a mobile DeepLink
In this file I also use this library to detect the device https://github.com/hicTech/navJs.
In $link_redirect = []; You add a list of urls as keys for the array and each key has a deeplink witch it will be used as redirection through the app
The redirection is made in the last JS, if you know the device, you can redirect the user to the store to download your app, "app store" or "google play".
